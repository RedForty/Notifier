# dkNotifier
This will one day be the grounds for a more robust notification system. For now, the only example I have is to warn you if your autokey is OFF. Helpful for animators that like using StudioLibrary or other tools that mess with autokey.

#### Installation
Copy the autoKey.py file to your maya/scripts folder. 


#### Usage
```
# Turn it on
import dkAutoKey
dkAutoKey.activate()
```

```
# Turn it off
dkAutoKey.deactivate()
```
